# Social-Media-Engagement-Dashboard

This project involves designing, developing, and testing an analytics visualization dashboard for social media influencers. The dashboard allows users to visualize and interact with engagement data from social media posts based on time period, channel name, and engagement rates. The primary goal was to parse, process, and visualize data containing influencer statistics while implementing sorting algorithms and user-interactive features in a graphical user interface (GUI) to deliver actionable insights for social media analytics.

Key Features:

• Reads influencer statistics from a CSV file and stores data in a Linked List for sorting and manipulation

• Implements a custom insertion sort to organize data by channel name or descending engagement rate using comparator classes

• GUI features a bar chart displaying engagement rates by channel and buttons allowing users to switch between months and toggle sorting based on various features

• Applies object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and interfaces to enable seamless interaction among classes and efficient communication between front-end and back-end.
